# TESTING STRATEGY

**Phase 1:** Launch Theme A (Fear/Urgency) across all 5 flyers — urgency typically converts best for first contact

**Phase 2:** If Theme A underperforms, test Theme B (Aspiration) — works well for premium positioning

**Phase 3:** Theme C (Trust) for retargeting/follow-up — builds credibility with warm leads

**Phase 4:** Theme D (Value) for price-sensitive segments or comparison shoppers

**A/B Testing:** Run 2 themes simultaneously per segment to identify which resonates with each curriculum's parent demographic.
